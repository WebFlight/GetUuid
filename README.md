# GetUuid
Simple java action that returns a random (type 4) UUID.

Simply drag the java action in the USEME folder into the microflow where you want to use it.
This module itself does not commit the UUID.
UUID Structure is RFC4122 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122). Collision chance is said to be 1 in a billion.
A demo of the project can be found at https://getuuid-sandbox.mxapps.io/
