# GetUuid
Simple java action that returns a random (type 4) UUID

UUID according to RFC4122 structure.
Collision chance is said to be around one in a billion.

A demo is available at https://getuuid-sandbox.mxapps.io/

Simple implementation - just add the java action to a microflow and use the returned value. The UUID is not committed automatically.
